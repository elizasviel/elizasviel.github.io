<p class="message">
  Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my page. I'm a recent college graduate living in New York, and for a long 
  time I was interested in finance and economics. In high school I traded stocks as a hobby, and in 
  college I studied finance and did internships in the industry.

   <br><br>

  These days I am learning to code, so I can eventually build applications to support my interests and my work.

   <br><br>

  I enjoy playing chess, traveling, and making new friends. Shoot me an email, or DM me on Twitter, and let's connect!
